        Fetch comprehensive market data for {crypto_name} to support the {forecast_horizon} forecast.
        
        Your task:
        1. Use the coingecko_tool to get historical OHLCV data optimized for the {forecast_horizon} forecast horizon:
           - For hour-based forecasts (1hr, 4hr, 12hr): Get 3-14 days of data
           - For day-based forecasts (1d, 3d, 7d): Get 1-3 months of data  
           - For week-based forecasts: Get 3-4 months of data
           - For month-based forecasts: Get 1 year of data
        2. Fetch current market statistics (price, volume, market cap)
        3. Analyze the data quality and key metrics
        
        IMPORTANT: Use the query format: "{crypto_name} ohlcv {forecast_horizon} horizon" to get optimal data amount.
        Example: coingecko_tool(query="{crypto_name} ohlcv {forecast_horizon} horizon")
        
        CRITICAL: Do NOT include the full OHLCV dataset in your response. Instead, provide only a CONCISE SUMMARY containing:
        - Current market price with timestamp
        - Data period covered (start date to end date)
        - Number of data points collected
        - Key price levels (recent high, low, average)

        Generate the final comprehensive {forecast_horizon} forecast and trading strategy for {crypto_name} by integrating sentiment and technical analysis.
        
        CRITICAL PRICE CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
        üö® You MUST use the CURRENT MARKET PRICE throughout your entire analysis. 
        üö® All targets, stop losses, and analysis must be based on the CURRENT price, not outdated data.
        üö® If you notice any price discrepancies in the data, FLAG them immediately.

        Your task:
        1. Review the sentiment analysis findings, paying attention to:
           - Overall sentiment scores
           - FUD/shill detection results
           - Key narrative themes
           - Source reliability considerations
        
        2. Review the technical analysis findings, focusing on:
           - Technical indicator signals
           - Chart pattern implications
           - Trend and momentum assessment
           - Support and resistance levels
           - Overall technical outlook
           - **MOST IMPORTANTLY: Current market price used in the analysis**
        
        3. PRICE VALIDATION STEP:
           - Identify the current market price from all sources
           - Ensure all your targets and analysis use this SAME current price
           - If you see conflicting prices (e.g., analysis mentioning $27,000 when current price is $105,000), STOP and report the inconsistency
           - Do NOT proceed with analysis if there are major price discrepancies (>10%)
        
        4. Synthesize the information considering:
           - Agreement or conflict between sentiment and technical signals
           - Reliability and strength of each signal type
           - Market volatility and uncertainty factors
           - Appropriate confidence levels
           - **Price consistency across all data sources**
        
        5. Provide your final comprehensive forecast in this EXACT format:
        
        **Direction**: [UP/DOWN/NEUTRAL]
        **Confidence level**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
        **Current Price**: $[price] (‚ö†Ô∏è MUST be the actual current market price)
        **Target Price(s)**:
        - **Primary Target**: $[price] (Probability: [%]%) - [reasoning based on CURRENT price]
        - **Secondary Target**: $[price] (Probability: [%]%) - [reasoning based on CURRENT price]
        
        **Stop Loss Level**: $[price] - [reasoning based on CURRENT price]
        **Take Profit Level(s)**:
        - **Take Profit 1**: $[price] - [reasoning based on CURRENT price]
        - **Take Profit 2**: $[price] - [reasoning based on CURRENT price]
        
        **Risk-Reward Ratio**: [ratio] ([calculation based on CURRENT price])
        **Position Size Recommendation**: [percentage]% of portfolio - [reasoning]
        **Time Horizon**: [timeframe] - [reasoning]
        **Key Catalysts**: [list of events/factors]
        **Risk Factors**: [list of risks]
        **Entry Strategy**: [detailed entry plan using CURRENT price]
        **Exit Strategy**: [detailed exit plan using CURRENT price]
        **Market Context**: [broader market analysis]
        
        **Detailed Analysis & Reasoning**:
        [Provide comprehensive step-by-step analysis that supports your direction, targets, and risk levels. 
        
        START your analysis by stating: "Current market price verified: $[price]"
        
        Explain how you integrated sentiment and technical signals. Be specific about what indicators or sentiment factors led to your conclusion. 
        
        ENSURE all price targets make sense relative to the current market price. If the current price is $105,000, targets of $25,000 would be completely unrealistic for any reasonable forecast timeframe.]
        
        IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
        - The **Direction** field MUST match your overall conclusion in the detailed analysis
        - Use specific price levels based on CURRENT market price, not ranges or vague terms
        - Include probability estimates for targets
        - Provide clear risk management guidelines
        - Your detailed analysis should support and align with your direction choice
        - Be consistent: if you say UP in direction, your analysis should primarily support bullish outlook
        - If conflicted signals, choose NEUTRAL and explain the uncertainty
        - **CRITICAL: All prices must be realistic relative to the current market price**
        
        PRICE CONSISTENCY WARNING:
        If you detect that the technical analysis was performed on stale price data (e.g., Bitcoin analyzed at $27,000 when current price is $105,000), immediately STOP and respond with:
        
        "üö® PRICE CONSISTENCY ERROR DETECTED üö®
        Analysis cannot proceed due to stale price data. Technical analysis appears to be based on price $[old_price] but current market price is $[current_price]. This creates unreliable forecasts. Please re-run the analysis with fresh data."
